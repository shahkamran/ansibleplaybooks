# Integrating within Atom
I am installing Atom to be able to edit and update repository using one of the best editor.

I couldn't get the integration working but have managed to install Git and can run the linux equivilant commands in Windows including following few useful commenats.
 git clone [repositorycloneaddress]
 git add *
 git commit -a -m "Comments go here"
 git commit -m "comments go here"
 git push
 git pull
 
 git config --global user.name "YOUR_USERNAME"
 git config --global user.email "your_email_address@example.com"
 git remote -v
